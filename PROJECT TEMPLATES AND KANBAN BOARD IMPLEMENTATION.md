# 1 Template Analysis and Selection

I have created a **Kanban Template**, a **Custom Template**, and a **Bug Tracker Project Template** under GitHub Projects.

| Template            | Features                                              | Best For                                      | Limitations |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Basic Kanban**    | Simple columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)             | Small teams, simple workflows                | No automation |
| **Bug Triage**      | Prioritizes and organizes bug reports                 | Large projects with frequent bug reports     | Not suited for feature tracking |
| **Custom Template** | Fully customizable columns & workflows                 | Teams with unique workflows                  | Requires manual setup |

I have chosen **Kanban Board** because it enhances the workflow visibility, efficiency, and productivity. Also assist in identifying the bottleneck, keeping teams on track, and measuring success.
