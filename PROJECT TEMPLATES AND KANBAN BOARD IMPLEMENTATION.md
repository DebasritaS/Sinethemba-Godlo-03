# 1 Template Analysis and Selection

I have created a 

| Template            | Features                                              | Best For                                      | Limitations |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Basic Kanban**    | Simple columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)             | Small teams, simple workflows                | No automation |
| **Automated Kanban** | Auto-updates based on issue status, WIP limits       | Sprint tracking, reducing manual work       | Less flexibility |
| **Automated Kanban with Reviews** | Adds a "Review" column for PR tracking | Code-heavy projects, CI/CD integration       | More complex setup |
| **Bug Triage**      | Prioritizes and organizes bug reports                 | Large projects with frequent bug reports     | Not suited for feature tracking |
| **Custom Template** | Fully customizable columns & workflows                 | Teams with unique workflows                  | Requires manual setup |
