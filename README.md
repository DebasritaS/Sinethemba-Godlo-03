# Automated User Access Review System

A User Access Review is a crucial component of the organization's security and compliance strategy. This process is conducted periodically to verify and validate users' access to IT application systems, ensuring that only necessary authorizations are granted. A well-functioning User Access Review System ensures appropriate access to the correct individuals.

## Documentation:

### Language Choice: Python 

I have chosen this language because of:

-**Simplicity and Readability:** Python's clean syntax made it easier to design, develop, and test complex system components like access requests, review cycles, and audit logs.
-**Rapid Prototyping:** Python allowed for faster iteration during development and debugging.
-**Strong Ecosystem:** Libraries like `unittest` for testing and `coverage` for test coverage helped enforce code quality and reliability.
-**Cross-platform Support:** Python runs smoothly across operating systems, which is useful for team collaboration and testing.

### Key Design Decisions

### ✅ Modular Architecture
- Classes like `User`, `AccessRequest`, `ReviewTask`, `ReviewCycle`, `AuditLog`, and `NotificationService` were each defined in separate modules under the `src/` directory.
- This structure follows the **Single Responsibility Principle** and makes unit testing easier.
  
### ✅ Clear Object-Oriented Structure
- Classes were chosen to represent real-world entities:
  - `User`: represents a system user.
  - `AccessRequest`: captures access request data.
  - `ReviewTask`: manages review assignments.
  - `ReviewCycle`: tracks periodic reviews.
  - `AuditLog`: records actions.
  - `NotificationService`: handles alerts.
- This made the code easy to extend and modify.

### ✅ Focus on Testability

- Used Python's built-in `unittest` framework for reliable and repeatable testing.
- Each class has dedicated test files under the `tests/` directory.
- Implemented **edge case** handling and validated correct initialization of attributes.
- 
### ✅ Audit Logging

- The `AuditLog` class ensures all critical events (like approvals or rejections) are captured for traceability and accountability.

### ✅ Notification Handling

- A minimal `NotificationService` was implemented to create user alerts and support communication channels like email/SMS notifications.

### Creational Patterns Justification

### ✅ Builder Pattern – `AccessRequest`
- **Why?** The `AccessRequest` object may contain multiple optional fields in real-world implementations (e.g., justification, urgency, resource type).
- **Benefit:** The builder pattern allows constructing complex access requests step-by-step while keeping the constructor clean and readable.
- 
### ✅ Factory Pattern – `ReviewTaskFactory` (optional enhancement)
- **Why?** If different types of review tasks (e.g., manual, automated, escalated) are required, a Factory pattern can generate the correct `ReviewTask` subtype based on parameters.
- **Benefit:** Simplifies object creation logic and allows extension without modifying client code.

### ✅ Singleton Pattern – `AuditLog`
- **Why?** The `AuditLog` acts as a centralized logger for all security-related actions. To maintain integrity, only one log should exist per runtime.
- **Benefit:** Ensures consistency and global access to a shared logging mechanism.

### ✅ Simple Instantiation – `User`, `NotificationService`
- **Why?** These objects are straightforward and do not involve optional parameters.
- **Benefit:** Keeps implementation clean and avoids unnecessary complexity where a pattern is not needed.
