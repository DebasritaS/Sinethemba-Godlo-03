# Automated User Access Review System

A User Access Review is a crucial component of the organization's security and compliance strategy. This process is conducted periodically to verify and validate users' access to IT application systems, ensuring that only necessary authorizations are granted. A well-functioning User Access Review System ensures appropriate access to the correct individuals.

## Documentation:

### Language Choice: Python 

I have chosen this language because of:

-**Simplicity and Readability:** Python's clean syntax made it easier to design, develop, and test complex system components like access requests, review cycles, and audit logs.
-**Rapid Prototyping:** Python allowed for faster iteration during development and debugging.
-**Strong Ecosystem:** Libraries like `unittest` for testing and `coverage` for test coverage helped enforce code quality and reliability.
-**Cross-platform Support:** Python runs smoothly across operating systems, which is useful for team collaboration and testing.

### Key Design Decisions

### ✅ Modular Architecture
- Classes like `User`, `AccessRequest`, `ReviewTask`, `ReviewCycle`, `AuditLog`, and `NotificationService` were each defined in separate modules under the `src/` directory.
- This structure follows the **Single Responsibility Principle** and makes unit testing easier.
  
### ✅ Clear Object-Oriented Structure
- Classes were chosen to represent real-world entities:
  - `User`: represents a system user.
  - `AccessRequest`: captures access request data.
  - `ReviewTask`: manages review assignments.
  - `ReviewCycle`: tracks periodic reviews.
  - `AuditLog`: records actions.
  - `NotificationService`: handles alerts.
- This made the code easy to extend and modify.

### ✅ Focus on Testability

- Used Python's built-in `unittest` framework for reliable and repeatable testing.
- Each class has dedicated test files under the `tests/` directory.
- Implemented **edge case** handling and validated correct initialization of attributes.
- 
### ✅ Audit Logging

- The `AuditLog` class ensures all critical events (like approvals or rejections) are captured for traceability and accountability.

### ✅ Notification Handling

- A minimal `NotificationService` was implemented to create user alerts and support communication channels like email/SMS notifications.

### Creational Patterns Justification

### ✅ Builder Pattern – `AccessRequest`
- **Why?** The `AccessRequest` object may contain multiple optional fields in real-world implementations (e.g., justification, urgency, resource type).
- **Benefit:** The builder pattern allows constructing complex access requests step-by-step while keeping the constructor clean and readable.
- 
### ✅ Factory Pattern – `ReviewTaskFactory` (optional enhancement)
- **Why?** If different types of review tasks (e.g., manual, automated, escalated) are required, a Factory pattern can generate the correct `ReviewTask` subtype based on parameters.
- **Benefit:** Simplifies object creation logic and allows extension without modifying client code.

### ✅ Singleton Pattern – `AuditLog`
- **Why?** The `AuditLog` acts as a centralized logger for all security-related actions. To maintain integrity, only one log should exist per runtime.
- **Benefit:** Ensures consistency and global access to a shared logging mechanism.

### ✅ Simple Instantiation – `User`, `NotificationService`
- **Why?** These objects are straightforward and do not involve optional parameters.
- **Benefit:** Keeps implementation clean and avoids unnecessary complexity where a pattern is not needed.

## Change Log

### [ChangeLog](https://github.com/Godlos252/Sinethemba-Godlo-03/blob/0f1643db39b564355b35d094f4cdf5e930364cea/CHANGELOG.md)


# Implementing a Persistence Repository Layer

### [Repository Interfaces]( https://github.com/Godlos252/Sinethemba-Godlo-03/tree/5514b56b8c199cde20b784fa6038f5afdb389d03/src/repositories)

Entity-specific repositories like `UserRepository`, `AccessRequestRepository`, and `ReviewCycleRepository` extend the generic repository interface we designed to abstract CRUD operations over domain entities. This separation enhances maintainability, allows mocking repositories in unit tests, and adheres to clean architecture principles.


### [In-Memory Implementation]( https://github.com/Godlos252/Sinethemba-Godlo-03/blob/5514b56b8c199cde20b784fa6038f5afdb389d03/src/repositories/in_memory_repository.py)


### [Abstraction Mechanism]( https://github.com/Godlos252/Sinethemba-Godlo-03/tree/714ffc9884a3f6c727ac8b738b2016d574bfbc70/src/factories)

I implemented the **Factory Pattern** instead of direct **Dependency Injection (DI)** for this project to manage repository instantiation.

Reason for Choosing the Factory Pattern:

- **Flexibility to Switch Storage Backends:** By using a RepositoryFactory, the system can easily switch between different storage implementations (e.g., in-memory, SQL database) without modifying business logic.
- **Centralized Creation Logic:** All instantiation details are isolated inside the factory class. This simplifies the management of different repository types, especially when new backends are added.
- **Reduces Tight Coupling:** Client classes (like services or controllers) don't need to know which storage backend they are working with — they just ask the factory for a repository. This aligns well with the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Ease of Testing:** During unit testing, a mock or in-memory repository can be injected easily by having the factory return a test version.

Why Not Only Dependency Injection?

- **DI** is great, but if used alone, it would require wiring dependencies manually throughout the application or adding a separate **DI** container.
- For a small-to-medium project like this, a **Factory** provides a simpler and more maintainable solution without the complexity of a full **DI** framework.

## CI Pipeline: Test Automation

1. **Set Up Your GitHub Actions Workflow**
*Here's an example ci.yml that:*

- Runs tests using pytest

- Saves test results (.xml or .html)

- Uploads them as artifacts

- Then (optionally) attaches them to a GitHub Release

2. **Trigger the Workflow by Tagging a Release**

  *Create a Git tag and push it:*
  
  *git tag v1.0.0*
  
  *git push origin v1.0.0*

  This will:
  
  - Run tests
  
 - Upload the test result as an artifact
  
  - Create a GitHub Release
  
  - Attach the results.xml to the release

   
3. **View the Results**
   
- Go to the Actions tab → click the workflow run.

- See the test logs under the "test" job.

- Click "Artifacts" to download the test report.

- OR visit the Releases tab in GitHub → click your release → download the test report file.

1. Ensure You Have a Test Job in Your Workflow
   
  - Your GitHub Actions YAML should have a test step.
    
2. Trigger the Workflow

   - Push a commit or open a pull request to trigger the workflow.

3. View Test Results in the GitHub UI

   - Go to your repo → Actions tab.
   - Click the workflow run.
   - In the Jobs section, click the test job.
   - Expand the "Run tests" step to see pytest or other test output.

## Documentation & PR Workflow

1. **Running Tests Locally**
  
  Make sure all dependencies are installed by running the following command:

  *pip install -r requirements.txt*
  
  Then run the tests using
  
  *PYTHONPATH=. Pytest*

2. **This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The pipeline runs automatically when you push a commit or create a pull request.**

•	**Pull Requests (PRs):**
  
	    Run tests (pytest)
  
	    Lint the code (if configured)
  
	    Must pass status checks before merging
  
•	**Merges to main:**

    Run tests
    
	  Build the package (.whl)

    Upload the release artifact

  Artifacts are only built and uploaded when a change is merged to the main branch.

**Create a Pull Request**

*Here’s how to demonstrate your rules:*

*Branch Protection*

Make sure these are already enabled under **Settings > Branches > main**:

- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Disable direct pushes

**Make a PR**

1. Create a new branch:
   
   - git checkout -b update-readme

Commit your changes to README.md:

  - git add README.md
  
  - git commit -m "Update README with test and CI/CD instructions"
  
  - git push origin update-readme

2.	Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request to the main.

Confirm in PR:

- Tests pass (you’ll see a green check)
  
- Cannot merge if tests fail
  
- Once merged, a .whl artifact is created in the Actions tab (if ci.yml is set up correctly)
