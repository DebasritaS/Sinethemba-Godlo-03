# Automated User Access Review System

A User Access Review is a crucial component of the organization's security and compliance strategy. This process is conducted periodically to verify and validate users' access to IT application systems, ensuring that only necessary authorizations are granted. A well-functioning User Access Review System ensures appropriate access to the correct individuals.

### Reflection

1. Improving the Repository Based on Peer Feedback
Early feedback from contributors and peers highlighted several areas for improvement — most notably, documentation gaps, unclear test coverage, and directory structure confusion. To address this, I created a comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md file with clear setup instructions, coding standards, and guidance on submitting pull requests. I also improved the test framework, fixed broken imports by correcting the module pathing, and restructured the src/ directory to be more intuitive.
Peer feedback also led me to tag beginner-friendly issues, improve error messages, and write a ROADMAP.md to communicate long-term goals. This helped new contributors better understand where the project was going and what they could contribute to. Small touches like adding a LICENSE file and a Getting Started section were directly inspired by feedback that newcomers felt “lost” when landing on the repo.

3. Challenges in Onboarding Contributors
The users liked and forked my project, one or two actioned the issues with formatting the CONTRIBUTION.md, there were no issues or challenges.

4. Lessons Learned About Open-Source Collaboration
One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is the value of clear communication and structure. Open-source projects live or die by how easily others can get involved. Documentation, issue tagging, and helpful code comments matter more than clever code.
I’ve also learned to be responsive but patient. Contributors sometimes submit partial pull requests, make formatting errors, or misunderstand the feature scope. Instead of rejecting those outright, I started offering supportive comments, linking style guides, and proposing changes. This mentorship-first mindset builds trust and encourages learning.
Another powerful takeaway was the benefit of automated workflows. Setting up GitHub Actions for continuous integration meant contributors got immediate feedback on their pull requests. This not only reduced my review burden but helped contributors troubleshoot problems independently.

## Documentation:

### Language Choice: Python 

I have chosen this language because of:

-**Simplicity and Readability:** Python's clean syntax made it easier to design, develop, and test complex system components like access requests, review cycles, and audit logs.
-**Rapid Prototyping:** Python allowed for faster iteration during development and debugging.
-**Strong Ecosystem:** Libraries like `unittest` for testing and `coverage` for test coverage helped enforce code quality and reliability.
-**Cross-platform Support:** Python runs smoothly across operating systems, which is useful for team collaboration and testing.

### Key Design Decisions

### ✅ Modular Architecture
- Classes like `User`, `AccessRequest`, `ReviewTask`, `ReviewCycle`, `AuditLog`, and `NotificationService` were each defined in separate modules under the `src/` directory.
- This structure follows the **Single Responsibility Principle** and makes unit testing easier.
  
### ✅ Clear Object-Oriented Structure
- Classes were chosen to represent real-world entities:
  - `User`: represents a system user.
  - `AccessRequest`: captures access request data.
  - `ReviewTask`: manages review assignments.
  - `ReviewCycle`: tracks periodic reviews.
  - `AuditLog`: records actions.
  - `NotificationService`: handles alerts.
- This made the code easy to extend and modify.

### ✅ Focus on Testability

- Used Python's built-in `unittest` framework for reliable and repeatable testing.
- Each class has dedicated test files under the `tests/` directory.
- Implemented **edge case** handling and validated correct initialization of attributes.
- 
### ✅ Audit Logging

- The `AuditLog` class ensures all critical events (like approvals or rejections) are captured for traceability and accountability.

### ✅ Notification Handling

- A minimal `NotificationService` was implemented to create user alerts and support communication channels like email/SMS notifications.

### Creational Patterns Justification

### ✅ Builder Pattern – `AccessRequest`
- **Why?** The `AccessRequest` object may contain multiple optional fields in real-world implementations (e.g., justification, urgency, resource type).
- **Benefit:** The builder pattern allows constructing complex access requests step-by-step while keeping the constructor clean and readable.
- 
### ✅ Factory Pattern – `ReviewTaskFactory` (optional enhancement)
- **Why?** If different types of review tasks (e.g., manual, automated, escalated) are required, a Factory pattern can generate the correct `ReviewTask` subtype based on parameters.
- **Benefit:** Simplifies object creation logic and allows extension without modifying client code.

### ✅ Singleton Pattern – `AuditLog`
- **Why?** The `AuditLog` acts as a centralized logger for all security-related actions. To maintain integrity, only one log should exist per runtime.
- **Benefit:** Ensures consistency and global access to a shared logging mechanism.

### ✅ Simple Instantiation – `User`, `NotificationService`
- **Why?** These objects are straightforward and do not involve optional parameters.
- **Benefit:** Keeps implementation clean and avoids unnecessary complexity where a pattern is not needed.

## Change Log

### [ChangeLog](https://github.com/Godlos252/Sinethemba-Godlo-03/blob/0f1643db39b564355b35d094f4cdf5e930364cea/CHANGELOG.md)


# Implementing a Persistence Repository Layer

### [Repository Interfaces]( https://github.com/Godlos252/Sinethemba-Godlo-03/tree/5514b56b8c199cde20b784fa6038f5afdb389d03/src/repositories)

Entity-specific repositories like `UserRepository`, `AccessRequestRepository`, and `ReviewCycleRepository` extend the generic repository interface we designed to abstract CRUD operations over domain entities. This separation enhances maintainability, allows mocking repositories in unit tests, and adheres to clean architecture principles.


### [In-Memory Implementation]( https://github.com/Godlos252/Sinethemba-Godlo-03/blob/5514b56b8c199cde20b784fa6038f5afdb389d03/src/repositories/in_memory_repository.py)


### [Abstraction Mechanism]( https://github.com/Godlos252/Sinethemba-Godlo-03/tree/714ffc9884a3f6c727ac8b738b2016d574bfbc70/src/factories)

I implemented the **Factory Pattern** instead of direct **Dependency Injection (DI)** for this project to manage repository instantiation.

Reason for Choosing the Factory Pattern:

- **Flexibility to Switch Storage Backends:** By using a RepositoryFactory, the system can easily switch between different storage implementations (e.g., in-memory, SQL database) without modifying business logic.
- **Centralized Creation Logic:** All instantiation details are isolated inside the factory class. This simplifies the management of different repository types, especially when new backends are added.
- **Reduces Tight Coupling:** Client classes (like services or controllers) don't need to know which storage backend they are working with — they just ask the factory for a repository. This aligns well with the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Ease of Testing:** During unit testing, a mock or in-memory repository can be injected easily by having the factory return a test version.

Why Not Only Dependency Injection?

- **DI** is great, but if used alone, it would require wiring dependencies manually throughout the application or adding a separate **DI** container.
- For a small-to-medium project like this, a **Factory** provides a simpler and more maintainable solution without the complexity of a full **DI** framework.

  Artifacts are only built and uploaded when a change is merged to the main branch.

**Create a Pull Request**

*Here’s how to demonstrate your rules:*

*Branch Protection*

Make sure these are already enabled under **Settings > Branches > main**:

- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Disable direct pushes

**Make a PR**

1. Create a new branch:
   
   - git checkout -b update-readme

Commit your changes to README.md:

  - git add README.md
  
  - git commit -m "Update README with test and CI/CD instructions"
  
  - git push origin update-readme

2.	Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request to the main.

Confirm in PR:

- Tests pass (you’ll see a green check)
  
- Cannot merge if tests fail
  
- Once merged, a .whl artifact is created in the Actions tab (if ci.yml is set up correctly)

### Reflection

1. Improving the Repository Based on Peer Feedback
Early feedback from contributors and peers highlighted several areas for improvement — most notably, documentation gaps, unclear test coverage, and directory structure confusion. To address this, I created a comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md file with clear setup instructions, coding standards, and guidance on submitting pull requests. I also improved the test framework, fixed broken imports by correcting the module pathing, and restructured the src/ directory to be more intuitive.
Peer feedback also led me to tag beginner-friendly issues, improve error messages, and write a ROADMAP.md to communicate long-term goals. This helped new contributors better understand where the project was going and what they could contribute to. Small touches like adding a LICENSE file and a Getting Started section were directly inspired by feedback that newcomers felt “lost” when landing on the repo.

3. Challenges in Onboarding Contributors
The users liked and forked my project, one or two actioned the issues with formatting the CONTRIBUTION.md, there were no issues or challenges.

4. Lessons Learned About Open-Source Collaboration
One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is the value of clear communication and structure. Open-source projects live or die by how easily others can get involved. Documentation, issue tagging, and helpful code comments matter more than clever code.
I’ve also learned to be responsive but patient. Contributors sometimes submit partial pull requests, make formatting errors, or misunderstand the feature scope. Instead of rejecting those outright, I started offering supportive comments, linking style guides, and proposing changes. This mentorship-first mindset builds trust and encourages learning.
Another powerful takeaway was the benefit of automated workflows. Setting up GitHub Actions for continuous integration meant contributors got immediate feedback on their pull requests. This not only reduced my review burden but helped contributors troubleshoot problems independently.
