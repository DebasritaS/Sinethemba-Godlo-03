# Reflection: Challenges in Prioritization, Estimation, and Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs

There were several challenges I faced in balancing the prioritization of requirements, estimating effort accurately, and aligning Agile methodologies with stakeholder needs.
Since I am currently the sole stakeholder, I encountered internal challenges, conflicts, and difficulties in decision-making, which reflect real-world challenges faced by teams during agile planning.

## 1. Challenges in Prioritization

One of the biggest challenges was determining which features were needed for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and those that could be submitted. Using the MoSCoW prioritization method, I struggled between Must-have and Should-have features.
  - **Conflicting Priorities:** Deciding which comes first between Audit Logs and MFA, and Core Access Review Functionalities was difficult because both  are important and impact the system's effectiveness and security.
  - **Balancing Stakeholder Expectations:** It was hard to decide as I was alone in the project on what must be prioritized because the Security team would prioritize robust logging and encryption and IT Administrators might push for user-friendly access review workflows.
## 2. Challenges in Estimation

Effort estimation using story points was another difficult task. Since Agile estimation relies on previous experience and team collaboration, working alone made it harder to gauge complexity and time requirements.
  - **Uncertainty in Technical Complexity:** Tasks like developing the approval/rejection workflow, seemed straightforward but required additional considerations like automated revocation rules and appeal processes.
  - **Lack of Historical Data:** Without a reference point for past sprint rates, estimating efforts were based on instinct rather than data-driven insights.

## 3. Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs

While Agile emphasizes iterative development and adaptability, aligning it with different stakeholders' needs was challenging in a single-person context.
  - **Resistance to Change:** Even though Agile supports change, some stakeholders (for example., compliance officers) prefer well-defined requirements upfront.
  - **Managing Technical vs. Business Priorities:** Balancing the priorities of different stakeholders without external input was difficult.
  - **Ensuring Sprint Deliverables Provide Value:** Agile encourages delivering working software in each sprint, but without real user feedback, validating if features truly address stakeholder concerns was a challenge.

Working alone in this planning phase made these challenges more difficult, but it also highlighted the importance of collaboration, iterative feedback, and clear prioritization frameworks.
