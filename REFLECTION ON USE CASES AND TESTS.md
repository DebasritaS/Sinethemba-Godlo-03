# Reflection: Challenges in Translating Requirements to Use Cases and Tests

Translating functional system requirements into use cases and test cases is a critical phase in software development, ensuring that the system functions as intended while meeting business and user needs. This reflection explores some of the key difficulties encountered when converting high-level requirements into detailed use cases and test cases.

- **Uncertainty in Requirements** One of the primary challenges is dealing with incomplete requirements. For instance, a requirement stating, "The system should allow access reviews," does not specify who initiates the review, how often it occurs, or what criteria should be considered. This lack of specificity requires further clarification through stakeholder discussions.

- **Managing Conflicting Stakeholder Needs** different stakeholders may have varying priorities, leading to conflicts that must be resolved before defining use cases. For example, security teams may prioritize strict access control, while end users seek a smooth experience with minimal disruptions. Balancing these needs requires balances and compromises that impact the final design of use cases and test scenarios.

- **Mapping Functional Requirements to Real-World Scenarios Functional** functional requirements describe what the system should do, but converting these into real world user cases and test cases require understanding of the user workflow. This can be challenging when desighning a complex workflow like "Auto-Revoke Unapproved Access", which requires system checks, multiple actors, compliance rules.

- **Aligning Non-Functional Requirements with Test Scenarios** Non-Functional Requirements like security, performance and scalablility are often harder to translate into test cases. Unlike functional requirements, which have clear pass/fail criteria, Non-Functional Requirements involve measurable but sometimes subjective benchmarks.

- **Tooling and Automation Challenges** Ensuring that test cases are automated where possible can update validation, but not all scenarios are easy to automate.

## Conclusion

Even though I had these challenges, I managed to translate the Functional and Non-Functional requirement into use cases and test case with a help of AI and draw.io (drawing use cases).
