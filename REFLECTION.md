# Reflection

## 1. Conflicting Priorities
   
   Might arise because of **Compliance and Audit Teams** that will prioritize more detailed logs and severe enforcement of policies. **Managers and Reviewers** might seek a simplified and easy process with minimal operating costs, while **IT and Security Teams** will focus on system reliability, security, and integration with existing infrastructure. The **End User** will also seek uninterrupted access and fewer disruptions during the access review process.
## 2. User Experience vs. Security & Compliance
   
   Having a balance between usability and compliance is vital to ensuring stakeholders are satisfied. **User interaction** becomes difficult sometimes because of security and compliance. For instance, **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** helps to improve security, but it can slow down review approvals. **Detailed access justifications** will increase the auditability while it frustrates users who would choose a quick approval process. **Auto-revocation of access** will increase security, but it can disrupt organization operations if it is not managed cautiously.
## 3. Automation vs. Human Oversight
   
   Combining both sometimes becomes an issue because the IAM Team and Security Analysts would require automation to apply access policies efficiently. **Managers and reviewers** may prefer human oversight, fearing mistakes of incorrect access revocation, while **Regulatory Bodies and Auditors** will need a clear step-by-step documentation of the automated decisions.
## 4. Scalability for Large Enterprises vs. Customization for SMEs
 
   Developing a system that will cater to both **Large** (with high scalability and dealing with thousands of users) and **Small Enterprises** (need customization option to suit their business structure) without excessive customization challenges is an architectural issue.
## 5. Integration Complexity
   
   Making sure that compatibility and long-term support for various integrations will become critical reasons why **IT Teams** will want integration that will have low disruptions, **DeveOPS** will need to have API strengths, and the **Compliance Team** will require assurance that there would not be any security vulnerabilities.
## 6. Performance Expectations vs. Data Accuracy
   
   Balancing fast performance with data integrity mechanisms is a critical challenge because the **End User** will expect real-time updates, **Auditors** need complete and accurate data, and **IT Teams** needs to ensure performance is high and the system is not interrupted.
