# Reflection

Havinig to choose the right fit Github Project Template and customizing it for your team can be challenging due to various factors such as:

Template Limitations: Basic Kanban lacks automantion and requires manual updates. Automated Kanban is strict, making customization harder (adding a new columns requires extra setup). 

Aligning with Workflow Needs: Some teams require a review stage (questions and answers or code review) in which default templates do not include. •	If using Agile sprints, GitHub’s Kanban does not inherently support sprint cycles like Jira or ClickUp.

Managing Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits:	GitHub’s built-in Kanban does not enforce WIP limits (unlike Trello or Monday.com, which allow automatic restrictions). Requires manual discipline or GitHub Actions to automate enforcement.
