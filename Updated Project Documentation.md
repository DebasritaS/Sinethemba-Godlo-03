US-001	As an Identity and Access Management Team, I want to schedule periodic access reviews so that user access can be reviewed on a timely basis.	Given an IAM Team, when setting up a review cycle, then the system should allow configuration of review frequency and deadlines.	High
US-002	As an IT Administrator, I want to assign reviewers to specific access review tasks so that the right people evaluate the correct user permissions.	Given an IT Administrator, when assigning a reviewer, then the system should allow role-based reviewer selection and notification.	High
US-003	As a Reviewer/Manager, I want to approve or reject user access requests so that only authorized users retain access to critical resources.	Given a Reviewer/Manager, when accessing a review task, then the system should provide approve/reject actions with justification options.	High

US-005	As an IAM Team Member, I want the system to integrate with IAM and HR systems so that access review data remains accurate and up to date.	Given an IAM Team Member, when syncing access data, then the system should pull user roles and permissions from external IAM and HR databases.	High
US-006	As a Risk Manager, I want unapproved access to be automatically revoked after a deadline so that security risks are minimized.	Given an unapproved access request, when the deadline is reached, then the system should automatically revoke access and notify stakeholders.	High
US-007	As an End User, I want to appeal a rejected access request so that I can justify why I need access to a resource.	Given an End User, when appealing a rejected request, then the system should allow submission of an appeal with supporting documentation.	Medium
