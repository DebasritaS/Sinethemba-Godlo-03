|Story ID |          	User Story	|                        Acceptance Criteria	                      |Priority        |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------- |----------------|
|US-001	|As an **Identity and Access Management Team**, I want to schedule periodic access reviews so that user access can be reviewed on a timely basis. |	Given an IAM Team, when setting up a review cycle, then the system should allow configuration of review frequency and deadlines.|	High|
|US-002 |	As an **IT Administrator**, I want to assign reviewers to specific access review tasks so that the right people evaluate the correct user permissions.|	Given an IT Administrator, when assigning a reviewer, then the system should allow role-based reviewer selection and notification.|	High|
|US-003	|As a **Reviewer/Manager**, I want to approve or reject user access requests so that only authorized users retain access to critical resources.|	Given a Reviewer/Manager, when accessing a review task, then the system should provide approve/reject actions with justification options.|	High|
|US-004	|As an **Auditor**, I want to generate compliance reports so that I can verify adherence to security and regulatory policies.	|Given an Auditor, when requesting reports, then the system should generate reports detailing review activities, approvals, and revocations.	|Medium|
|US-005	|As an **IAM Team Member**, I want the system to integrate with IAM and HR systems so that access review data remains accurate and up to date.|	Given an IAM Team Member, when syncing access data, then the system should pull user roles and permissions from external IAM and HR databases.	|High|
|US-006	|As a **Risk Manager**, I want unapproved access to be automatically revoked after a deadline so that security risks are minimized.	|Given an unapproved access request, when the deadline is reached, then the system should automatically revoke access and notify stakeholders.	|High|
|US-007	|As an **End User**, I want to appeal a rejected access request so that I can justify why I need access to a resource.	|Given an End User, when appealing a rejected request, then the system should allow submission of an appeal with supporting documentation.	|Medium|
|US-008	|As an **External Auditor**, I want to access detailed logs of past access reviews so that I can assess compliance for regulatory audits.|	Given an External Auditor, when accessing review logs, then the system should provide read-only access to historical audit logs.	|Medium|
|US-009	|As a **Risk Manager**, I want to receive notifications about pending access reviews so that I can complete my tasks on time.	|Given a Risk Manager, when an access review is pending, then the system should send an email and dashboard alert.	|High|
|US-010	|As a **Reviewer**, I want to request additional information from users before making an access decision so that I can ensure accurate approvals.|	Given a Reviewer, when reviewing access, then the system should allow sending clarification requests to the user.|	Medium|

|Story ID |          	User Story	|                        Acceptance Criteria	                      |Priority        |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------- |----------------|
|NF-001	|As a **DevOps Engineer**, I want the system to handle 1000+ concurrent users so that it remains responsive during peak access review periods.|	Given 1000+ concurrent users, when performing actions, then the system should maintain response times below 2 seconds for 95% of requests.|	High|
|NF-002	|As a **Security Administrator**, I want the system to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) so that only authorized users can access sensitive review data.	|Given a user login attempt, when MFA is required, then the system should prompt for an additional authentication factor before granting access.	|High|
|NF-003	|As an **IT Administrator**, I want the system to automatically scale based on load so that performance remains stable under high traffic.	|Given a high workload, when system utilization reaches 80% CPU/memory, then auto-scaling should provision additional resources.	|High|
|NF-004	|As a **Compliance Officer**, I want all access review actions to be logged so that audit trails are available for compliance verification.|	Given a review decision, when an action is taken, then the system should log the event with timestamps, user details, and changes made.|	High|
|NF-005	|As a **Database Administrator**, I want data encryption at rest and in transit so that sensitive access information is secure.|	Given stored or transmitted data, when accessing the database or API, then encryption standards (AES-256, TLS 1.2+) should be enforced.|	High|
|NF-006	|As an **End User**, I want the system to provide a simple and intuitive interface so that I can complete access reviews efficiently.|Given a user interface, when navigating the system, then key actions should be accessible within 3 clicks and include tooltips.	|Medium|
|NF-007	|As a **System Administrator**, I want the system to provide real-time monitoring and alerts so that I can proactively address performance or security issues.	|Given anomaly detection, when an issue (e.g., high load, failed logins) is detected, then the system should trigger alerts via email/SMS/logging system.	|High|
|NF-008	|As a **Manager**, I want the system to maintain 99.9% uptime so that access reviews are not disrupted.|	Given system availability, when monitoring uptime over a month, then downtime should not exceed 43 minutes per month.	|High|
